# Tranche D1 — timestamp check (case 1)

0 undecided segments across 0 videos. **This is the only part of File 3 that needs the video.**

Open each deep link and confirm the named person is the one who starts speaking there.

- right speaker, right moment → `final_action=accept`
- wrong time → fix `start_seconds` / `end_seconds` in place, `final_action=edit`
- not a real talk (applause, interlude, header text) → `final_action=skip`

Initials in `reviewer` either way. Blank = the segment is silently discarded.

**When you skip a segment, check the one before it.** Its `end_seconds` was derived from the skipped segment's start, so it now stops early — extend it to the next surviving start, or clear it to run to the end of the video.

`covers` is how much of the video a segment spans — triage only, not a verdict. A video whose segments account for nearly all of it is likely well cut; a low figure or a flagged trailing gap means time is unaccounted for, which is what a bad split looks like.

`—` in *links as* means no `person_key`: the record is still built, with no presenter linked.
